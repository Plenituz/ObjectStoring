# ObjectStoring
store and load objects as a json file according to attributes you put on the members of the class

See each attributes in Attributes folder to know what you can do with this system.

Note: this won't compile as provided, you will need to change some things since it depends on other classes not in this repo
(Logger for example) but if you remove any reference to them it should still work

Note 2: any element that will be part of an array when saved should implement the IHasHost interface
